\maketitle

In this document, we consider a general class of nonlocal computational model seen in various fields, such as Peridynamics \cite{CMPer-Silling5,BobaruHu,HaBobaru,CMPer-Agwai,CMPer-Ghajari,Diehl,CMPer-Lipton2,CMPer-JhaLipton2,CMPer-JhaLipton5}, discrete element method \cite{NM-Desai,NM-Desai2,NM-Gladkyy,NM-Lobo,NM-Dosta}, Peridynamics plus discrete element method for granular media \cite{NM-Zhu, NM-Masoud}, nonlocal cell-cell adhesion in computational biology \cite{armstrong2006continuum,engwer2017structured,stinner2014global}, nonlocal heat equation \cite{burch2011classical,du2012analysis}. References above are only minuscule fraction of what is available. The application of nonlocal modeling method for understanding of complex spatially multiscale phenomenon is seen in various new fields such as fluid mechanics, particulate media, directed self-assembly of Block-Copolymers, tumor modeling, etc. What is more interesting and also convenient is that underlying algorithm which is used to numerically solve these nonlocal models is more or less same and therefore the efficient computational method available for one type of nonlocal model can be easily applied to the nonlocal model in other fields.

It is our understanding that efficient computational method to solve the nonlocal model is very important. It is widely known that the nonlocal models are much more computationally demanding compared to their counterpart, namely local models (such as heat equation, wave equation, etc). This is because the length of interaction in nonlocal model is typically 3 to 10 times larger than the size of discretization and therefore, the usual local assembly of matrix and vector considered in solution of pdes (partial differential equation) is not feasible. The efficient parallel implementation because of long-range interaction is difficult due to dependence over much larger length scale. 

In this document we present this problem using simple example of nonlocal diffusion equation, see \cite{burch2011classical} and references therein for more information. Our main goal is to highlight key difficulties in designing massively parallel scheme for nonlocal models while keeping the model related complexity to minimum. For this purpose nonlocal heat equation is suitable. Further, to fix the ideas we only consider two dimensional setting. 

In this work we use parallel API called HPX. HPX is an open source asynchronous many task run time system that focuses on high performance computing~\cite{Heller2017,tabbal2011preliminary,kaiser2014hpx}. HPX provides wait-free asynchronous execution and futurization for synchronization. It also features parallel execution policies utilizing a task scheduler, which enables a fine-grained load balancing parallelization and synchronization due to work stealing. HPX is in strict adherence to the C++ $11$~\cite{cxx11_standard} and C++ $17$ standard definitions~\cite{cxx17_standard}.\\


\section{Nonlocal diffusion equation}
In this section we give brief overview of nonlocal diffusion equation for temperature field $u$ over an square domain $D = [0,1]^2$ subjected to zero temperature condition on its boundary and subjected to given heat source distribution within the domain. It is a first order transient equation in time. For simplification, we only consider explicit time integration scheme, namely forward Euler scheme. For spatial discretization, we consider uniform mesh over domain $D$ and consider finite difference approximation (also commonly referred to as particle discretization). The resulting final equations are very simple and serial implementation requires only few lines of code, see \autoref{alg:serial}. With HPX, thread-level parallel implementation and shared-memory parallel implementation is almost as simple as serial implementation, see \autoref{alg:semi parallel}. 

Our goal is to fully parallelize the solver, i.e. starting from mesh partition to computation of fields at mesh nodes. We proceed step wise starting from serial implementation, to shared-memory parallel implementation, and to fully parallel implementation and discuss the challenges going from one step to next. 

Let material domain is $D = [0,1]^2$ and time domain $I = [0,T]$. We fix size of horizon (length over one point interacts with another, also called nonlocal length scale) $\epsilon>0$. Let $D_c = (-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)^2 - D$ be the nonlocal boundary of thickness $\epsilon$ surrounding $D$. See \autoref{fig:domain}. We define $H_r(x)$ as two-dimensional open ball of radius $r$ centered at $x\in \R^2$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{material_domain.png}
\caption{Material domain $D$ and nonlocal boundary $D_c$. Figure shows typical material point $x\in D$ and ball $H_\epsilon(x)$. }\label{fig:domain}
\end{figure}

Let $u:I \times D\cup D_c \to \R$ is a temperature field. Let $J:\R \to \R$ be positive function such that $0\leq J(r) \leq M$ for $r\in [0,1]$ and $J(r) = 0$ for $r\notin [0,1]$. We refer to $J$ as influence function. 

$u(t,x)$ satisfies following nonlocal diffusion equation, $\forall x\in D \text{ and } \forall t \in I$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:diff eqn}
\partial_t u(t,x) &=  b(t,x) \notag \\
&\,+ c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)} J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) (u(t,y) - u(t,x)) dy,
\end{align}
where $b(t,x)$ is the external source at time $t$ and at point $x$ (this is a known function of space and time). Initial condition is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:ic}
u(0,x) = u_0(x) \qquad \forall x\in D
\end{align}
and boundary condition is given by
\begin{align} \label{eq:bc}
u(t,x) = 0 \qquad \forall x\in D_c \text{ and } \forall t\in I.
\end{align}

Constant $c$ is chosen such that in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$ the nonlocal operator in right-hand side of \autoref{eq:diff eqn}. goes to $k\nabla \cdot \nabla u$. Local diffusion equation is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:locdiff}
\partial_t u(t,x) &= k \nabla \cdot \nabla u(t,x),
\end{align}
where $k$ is the diffusivity constant. Boundary condition is $u = 0$ on $\partial D$ (consistent with boundary condition in \autoref{eq:bc} and initial condition is $u(0,x) = u_0(x)$. Constant $c$ is taken as
\begin{align}\label{eq:constc}
c &:= \begin{cases}
\frac{k}{\epsilon^3 M_2}, \qquad \text{when dimension }d=1 \\
\frac{2k}{\pi\epsilon^4 M_3}, \qquad \text{when dimension }d=2,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}\label{eq:momentJ}
M_i = \int_0^1 J(r) r^i dr.
\end{align}
For standard influence functions, $M_i$ can be computed easily. For example, when $J = 1$, $M_i = 1/(i+1)$, when $J = 1- r$, $M_2 = 1/12, M_3 = 1/20$, etc.

With choice of constant $c$ in \autoref{eq:constc}, it can be shown formally (see \autoref{s:converge}) that
\begin{align}\label{eq:limit}
c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)}  J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) (u(t,y) - u(t,x)) dy \to k \nabla \cdot \nabla u(t,x).
\end{align}

\section{Finite difference approximation}\label{s:fd}
Consider uniform mesh $D_h = (D\cup D_c)\cap (h\Z)^2$ of mesh size $h >0$, see \autoref{fig:mesh fd}. $\Z$ is the set of positive and negative integers. Let $\Delta t$ is size of time step and $[0,T]\cap (\Delta t \Z)$ be the discretization of time domain. We assume $\epsilon = m h$ where $m\geq 1$ is some integer.

We consider index set $K \subset \Z^2$ such that for $i\in K$, $x_i = h i \in D$. Similarly, consider index set $K_c \subset \Z^2$ such that for $i\in K_c$, $x_i = h i \in D_c$.

Let $\hat{u}^k_i$ be the solution of forward Euler discretization in time. It satisfies,$\forall 1\leq k \leq T/\Delta t, \forall i \in K$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:forward fd}
\dfrac{\hat{u}^{k+1}_i - \hat{u}^k_i}{\Delta t} &= b(t^k, x_i) \notag \\
&+ c \sum_{\substack{j \in K\cup K_c,\\
|x_j-x_i| \leq \epsilon}} J(|x_j - x_i|/\epsilon) (\hat{u}^k_j - \hat{u}^k_i) V_j
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\hat{u}^k_i = 0 \qquad \forall 0\leq k \leq T/\Delta t, \forall i \in K_c.
\end{align}
At $k=0$, we have $\hat{u}^0_i = u_0(x_i)$ for all $i\in K$. $V_j$ is the volume occupied by node $j$ and in our case we have $V_j = h^2$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{mesh_uniform.png}
\caption{Uniform mesh of size $h$. Shaded area corresponds to nonlocal boundary $D_c$. We specify zero temperature on all the mesh nodes in the shaded area. For mesh node $x_i$ in $D$, we consider interaction of $x_i$ with all the mesh nodes inside the green shaded ball.}\label{fig:mesh fd}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Serial and semi-parallel implementation of forward euler scheme}
Algorithm for  serial implementation is given in \sref{Algorithm}{alg:serial}. For parallel implementation, we will use parallel for loop (HPX utility). See \sref{Algorithm}{alg:semi parallel}. In \sref{Algorithm}{alg:semi parallel}, we observe that temperature data of all mesh nodes is stored in single data variable, ``$U$", and similarly, neighbor list of all the mesh nodes are stored in single data variable, ``neighborList". We refer to this as semi-parallel as we have only parallelized for-loop and not the data. In fully parallel implementation, data will also be divided in number of computational nodes and each computational node will own data corresponding to it. This requires mesh partition. We discuss this in next section.

\section{Parallelization and mesh partition}
Given $N$ number of computational nodes, mesh will be partitioned in $N$ parts such that each computational node will store the information corresponding to the mesh partition it owns. For example, consider 4 computers connected by network. We would like to run the problem on all 4 computers in parallel. We will partition the mesh in four parts, see \autoref{fig:mesh partition}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{mesh_partition.png}
\caption{Typical mesh partition. Mesh nodes under each color are owned by the respective computer.}\label{fig:mesh partition}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:mesh partition}, the mesh is colored to show the partition. Consider part of mesh colored as green. Let us suppose the id of computer who owns the green, blue, yellow, and red are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. We now focus on one computational node, say green, and present two possible situations.

\textbf{Case 1: }Consider mesh node $x_i$ which belongs to computer 1's partition. Let us suppose that $x_i$ is within the dashed line, see \autoref{fig:green case 1}. For such $x_i$, all mesh nodes $x_j \in H_\epsilon(x_i)$  will be within the green partition. Since computer 1 owns the mesh data of green partition, calculation of right hand side of \autoref{eq:forward fd}, i.e. $c J(|x_j - x_i|/\epsilon)(\hat{u}^k_j - \hat{u}^k_i)V_j$, can be carried out without needing to interact with other computers. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{mesh_partition_green_case_1.png}
\caption{Mesh nodes of green partition which are within dashed line do not interact with partition owned by other computers.}\label{fig:green case 1}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Case 2: }Now consider another mesh node $x_i$ in green partition. This mesh node is close to the boundary of green partition, and we see that there are mesh nodes $x_j$ which are in ball $H_\epsilon(x_i)$, but which are not part of green partition. For example, we consider $x_j \in H_\epsilon(x_i)$ in \autoref{fig:green case 2}. Mesh node $x_j$ is in Blue partition. Blue partition is owned by computer 2. Therefore, to compute the right hand side term in \autoref{eq:forward fd}, computer 1 has to request the information associated to mesh node $x_j$ from computer 2. We see that for all the mesh nodes in Green partition which are outside dash line, computer 1 will have to communicate with other computers for the information. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{mesh_partition_green_case_2.png}
\caption{In first example, mesh node $x_i$ of Green partition interacts with few mesh nodes of Blue partition owned by computer 2. In second example, we see that $x_i$ of Green mesh interacts with mesh nodes owned by computer 2, 3, and 4.}\label{fig:green case 2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Algorithm for fully parallel code}
Consider \sref{Algorithm}{alg:parallel} which outlines the steps needed to run the problem in fully parallel framework. Following are the list of steps which will require effort in implementing \sref{Algorithm}{alg:parallel}.

\noindent \textbf{1. Partitioning of mesh: }Libraries are available which can partition the mesh into given number of computational nodes.

\noindent \textbf{2. List of interacting mesh nodes owned by other computational node: }If global mesh data is available to each computational node then we can create a list of interacting neighboring mesh nodes which are owned by other computational node. This list will have global id, which is unique, of mesh nodes. 

\noindent \textbf{3. Sharing of information: }For given computational node, we need to implement the method which shares information to other computational node and which receives the information from other computational node. For this we need a list of information to be shared and communication method available in HPX framework.

\section{Constructing exact solution}
The idea is to use source term $b$ to construct the analytical solution. This is shown next.

\subsection{One dimension}
Let $$w(t,x) = \cos(2\pi t) \sin(2\pi x)$$ when $x\in [0,1]$ and $w(t,x) = 0$ when $x\notin [0,1]$. We want solution of \autoref{eq:diff eqn} $u$ to be equal to $w$, i.e., $u = w$. To achieve this we substitute 
\begin{align}\label{eq:source exact 1d}
b(t,x) &= \partial_t w(t,x) \notag \\
&\,-  c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)} J(|y-x|/\epsilon) (w(t,y) - w(t,x)) dy 
\end{align}
in \autoref{eq:diff eqn} and prescribe $u(0,x) = w(0,x) = \sin(2\pi x)$ as initial condition on $u$ and $u(t,x) = 0$ on $x\in D_c$ as boundary condition. Note that $$ \partial_t w(t,x) = -2\pi \sin(2\pi t) \sin(2\pi x) $$ when $x\in [0,1]$ and $\partial_t w(t,x) = 0$ when $x\notin [0,1]$.

\subsection{Two dimension}
Let $$w(t,x) = \cos(2\pi t) \sin(2\pi x_1)  \sin(2\pi x_2)$$ when $x\in [0,1]^2$ and $w(t,x) = 0$ when $x\notin [0,1]^2$. We substitute 
\begin{align}\label{eq:source exact 2d}
b(t,x) &= \partial_t w(t,x) \notag \\
&\, -  c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)} J(|y-x|/\epsilon) (w(t,y) - w(t,x)) dy 
\end{align}
in \autoref{eq:diff eqn} and prescribe $$u(0,x) = w(0,x) = \sin(2\pi x_1)\sin(2\pi x_2)$$ as initial condition on $u$ and $u(t,x) = 0$ on $x\in D_c$ as boundary condition. 

To obtain numerical solution $\hat{u}^k_i$ following discretization \autoref{eq:forward fd}, we essentially have to compute source $b$ at time $t=t^k = k\Delta t$ and point $x = x_i = ih$ using the formula \autoref{eq:source exact 1d} (in 1-d simulation) and \autoref{eq:source exact 2d} (in 2-d simulation).

\subsection{Numerical discretization error}
Suppose $\bar{u}(t,x)$ is the exact solution and $\hat{u}^k_i$ for $0\leq k \leq T/\Delta t$ and $i\in K$ is the numerical solution. The total error at time $t^k$ is taken as
\begin{align}\label{eq:err}
e^k &:= h^d \sum_{i\in K} |\bar{u}(t^k, x_i) - \hat{u}^k_i|^2,
\end{align}
where $d=1,2$ is the dimension. Total error can be defined as $e:= \sum_{0\leq k\leq T/\Delta t} e^k$.


\section{Limit of nonlocal operator to local operator in diffusion equation}\label{s:converge}
We show through formal calculation that 
\begin{align*}
c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)}  J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) (u(y) - u(x)) dy \to k \nabla \cdot \nabla u(x).
\end{align*}

Let 
\begin{align}\label{eq:opL}
\calL(u)(x) = c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)}  J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) (u(y) - u(x)) dy,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}\label{eq:constc 2}
c &:= \begin{cases}
\frac{k}{\epsilon^3 M_2}, \qquad \text{when dimension }d=1 \\
\frac{2k}{\pi\epsilon^4 M_3}, \qquad \text{when dimension }d=2,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
with $M_i = \int_0^1 J(r) r^i dr$. 

Taylor's series approximation gives:
\begin{align*}
u(y) &= u(x) + \nabla u(x) \cdot (y-x) + \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 u(x)\bcolon (y-x) \dyad (y-x) \notag \\
&\,+ \frac{1}{6} \nabla^3 u(\xi) \bcolon (y-x)\dyad (y-x) \dyad (y-x),
\end{align*}
where $\xi = \xi(y,x) \in D\cup D_c$. We substitute above in \autoref{eq:opL} to get
\begin{align*}
&\calL(u)(x) \notag \\
&= c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)}  J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) \nabla u(x) \cdot (y-x) dy\notag \\
&\, +  c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)}  J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 u(x)\bcolon (y-x) \dyad (y-x) dy \notag \\
&\, +  c \int_{H_\epsilon(x)}  J(\frac{|y-x|}{\epsilon}) \frac{1}{6} \nabla^3 u(\xi) \bcolon (y-x)\dyad (y-x) \dyad (y-x) dy.
\end{align*}
First term in above is zero as $J$ is even function of $y$ and $(y-x)$ is odd function. We consider change in variable $y = x + \epsilon \eta$ where $\eta \in H_1(0)$. Note that $dy = \epsilon^d d\eta$ where $d$ is dimension. We have
\begin{align}\label{eq:opL2}
&\calL(u)(x) \notag \\
&= c \int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 u(x)\bcolon \epsilon \eta \dyad \epsilon \eta  \epsilon^d d\eta \notag \\
&\, +  c \int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \frac{1}{6} \nabla^3 u(\xi) \bcolon \epsilon \eta \dyad \epsilon \eta \dyad \epsilon \eta  \epsilon^d d\eta \notag \\
&= \frac{c\epsilon^{d+2}}{2}  \nabla^2 u(x) \bcolon \left[ \int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \eta \dyad \eta d\eta \right] \notag \\
&\, + \frac{c\epsilon^{d+3}}{6} \int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \nabla^3 u(\xi) \bcolon \eta \dyad\eta \dyad\eta d\eta .
\end{align}
Assuming $u$ is such that $|\nabla^3 u| < \infty$ at all points, third term is of the order $$O(c|\nabla^3 u| \epsilon^{d+3})$$. We analyze the term in square bracket next. 

\paragraph{One dimension} When $d=1$, we have
\begin{align}
&\int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \eta \dyad \eta d\eta\notag \\
&=\int_{-1}^1 J(|\eta|) \eta^2 d\eta \notag \\
&= 2\int_0^1 J(r) r^2 dr = 2 M_2,
\end{align}
where we used the fact that $J(|\eta|) \eta^2$ is even and noted the definition of moment $M_2$. Substituting this in \autoref{eq:opL2} and noting the definition of constant $c$ in \autoref{eq:constc 2}, we conclude that
$$
\calL(u)(x) = k \partial_{xx} u(x) + O(|\partial_{xxx}u| \epsilon).
$$
Taking $\epsilon \to 0$ gives $\calL(u) \to k\partial_{xx} u$.

\paragraph{Two dimension} When $d=2$, we have
\begin{align*}
&\int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \eta \dyad \eta d\eta\notag \\
&=\int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} J(|\eta|) \eta\dyad\eta rdrd\theta \notag \\
&= \left(\int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} J(|\eta|) \eta_i \eta_j rdrd\theta \right) e_i \dyad e_j.
\end{align*}
Where $e_1, e_2$ are basis vector in 2-d, $i,j\in \{1,2\}$, and Einstein summation is implied above. Note that in cylindrical coordinate, $\eta_1 = r\cos(\theta), \eta_2 = r\sin(\theta)$ and $|\eta| = r$. We use following trigonometric identities
\begin{align}\label{eq:trig}
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2(\theta) d\theta &= \pi, \notag \\
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin^2(\theta) d\theta &= \pi, \notag \\
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) d\theta &= 0
\end{align}
to get 
$$
 \int_0^{2\pi} \eta_i \eta_j d\theta = r^2 \pi \delta_{ij}
$$
where $\delta_{ij} = 0$ if $i\neq j$ and $\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i=j$. Substituting to get
\begin{align*}
&\int_{H_1(0)}  J(|\eta|) \eta \dyad \eta d\eta\notag \\
&= \left(\int_0^1 J(r)  r^3 dr \right) \pi \delta_{ij} e_i \dyad e_j \notag \\
&= \pi M_3 \delta_{ij} e_i \dyad e_j,
\end{align*}
Substituting this in \autoref{eq:opL2} and noting the definition of constant $c$ in \autoref{eq:constc 2}, we get
\begin{align*}
&\calL(u)(x) \notag \\
&\, = \frac{c\epsilon^{4}}{2} \pi M_3 \nabla^2 u(x) \bcolon \delta_{ij} e_i \dyad e_j  + O(c|\nabla^3 u| \epsilon^5)\notag \\
&\, =  \frac{c\epsilon^{4}}{2} \pi M_3 \nabla \cdot \nabla u(x) + O(c|\nabla^3 u| \epsilon^5),
\end{align*}
where we used the fact that $$\nabla^2 u(x) \bcolon \delta_{ij} e_i \dyad e_j  = \nabla \cdot \nabla u(x).$$ Substituting definition of $c$ from \autoref{eq:constc 2} to get
$$
\calL(u)(x) = k \nabla \cdot \nabla u(x) + O(|\nabla^3 u| \epsilon).
$$
Taking $\epsilon \to 0$ gives $\calL(u) \to k\nabla \cdot \nabla u$.
